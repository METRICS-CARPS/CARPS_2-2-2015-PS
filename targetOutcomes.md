For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the section "Dietary self-control and the speed at which tastiness and healthfulness are computed"

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Dietary self-control and the speed at
which tastiness and healthfulness are
computed

> To address whether individual differences in dietary self control were associated with differences in the relative speed at which the healthfulness and tastiness attributes
were computed, we began by comparing how taste and
health information were reflected in the mouse trajectories
for individuals with high versus low self-control, as
defined using a median split of the SCSR statistic. As
shown in Figure 5a, we found substantial differences
across the groups. In particular, in the high-self-control
group, the paths for tastiness and healthfulness were
quite similar and became significantly greater than zero
at approximately the same time (healthfulness: t = 67;
tastiness: t = 60). In contrast, for the low-self-control
group, the latency at which tastiness became significant
was similar to that of the high-self-control group (t = 56),
but the latency for healthfulness occurred much later (t =
85). As before, we tested for the significance of these differences
by estimating at the individual level the earliest
time at which healthfulness became significantly greater
than zero and then comparing the distributions. The normalized
time at which tastiness and healthfulness became
significant did not differ significantly for high-self-control
subjects (mean healthfulness: t = 69.50; mean tastiness:
t = 68.54; mean difference = −2.9), t(9) = −0.46, p = .33
(one-tailed), but they were significantly different in the
low-self-control group (mean healthfulness: t = 81.22;
mean tastiness: t = 61.35; mean difference = −16), t(8) =
−2.5, p = .02 (one-tailed).
