Example code for analyses from:

Sullivan, N. J., Hutcherson, C. A., Harris, A., Rangel, A. Dietary self-control is related to the speed with which health and taste attributes are processed. Psychological Science. Forthcoming.

Run MATLAB script code.m from a directory with both data files (sullivanEtAl2014ForPub_mouse.csv and sullivanEtAl2014ForPub_key.csv) to approximately replicate graphs and statistics from the paper. 

To plot average mouse trajectories (figure 2c) you need script plotTwoDimError.m in the same folder or your startup path. It is also included in this database.

There are many ways to exclude mouse response trials due to excessively complicated trajectories (i.e. the subject was playing with his/her mouse and not following our instruction to move continuously to the chosen option). I encourage you to play with the code by excluding trajectories in several different ways or not excluding trials at all to see how results differ.
